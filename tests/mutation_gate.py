"""Assert that the suite fails when the product is broken.

A test suite reports two things with the same output: that the product works,
and that nothing is checking it. `0 errors` is printed either way. Every gap
found in this library over one week was of the second kind — the behaviour was
tested and the *call site* was not, or the default that ships was never
exercised — and every one was caught by hand, after the code was written.

This gate closes that by construction. Each entry below is a **real** defect
that was written, passed review, and was caught late. The value is entirely in
that: an invented mutation proves a test can fail, a real one proves the suite
would have stopped the thing that actually happened.

    python3 tests/mutation_gate.py          # all mutations
    python3 tests/mutation_gate.py --list   # names only

A surviving mutation is a failure of this gate, not a curiosity: it means the
behaviour it describes could be removed today and the suite would stay green.

There are two mutation gates, and this is the Python one. The answer gate that
ships to store operators has its own, `tests/explorer/answer-regression-mutations.mjs`,
because its defects live in the shipped `.mjs` runner and are only observable by
breaking a built page. Three successive versions of that runner's ticket predicate
passed every assertion here and in the page regression while failing to notice a
dead file-to-ticket join. Neither gate covers the other.
